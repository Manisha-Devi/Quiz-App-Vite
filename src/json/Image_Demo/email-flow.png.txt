[This would be an actual PNG image file showing email flow from sender through SMTP server to recipient]

To use real images:
1. Replace this .txt file with an actual email-flow.png image
2. The image should show the flow: Sender → SMTP Server → Recipient's Email Server → Recipient
3. Make sure the filename matches exactly: email-flow.png
